@Faranight To fetch tags specifically, you'll want to use GET /deviation/metadata, but you'll first need the deviationid UUID. AFAIK the only way to get that is to query the API using a /gallery/ endpoint, which will return the UUID as well as other data. So essentially to find a deviation based off a URL, you have to match the URL given with the url field for any given deviation.
and yes, I'm stupid and didn't clearly see the tags on the deviation pages.
It is, of course, easier to continually query DeviantArt's /gallery/ API endpoints until you find the matching image as opposed to writing a manual data scraper from the page.
wot
Although the DeviantArt API is specifically designed to not allow you to find deviationid UUIDs with a URL, these UUIDs appear to be clearly exposed with the HTML meta-tag defined apple-itunes-app, so you can easily scrape it there. You don't have to code too much around this because you can only fetch the header of the HTML page and read it using some sort of DOM handling. (PHP has the DOM extension, JavaScript is probably well suited to this but I haven't touched it in ages.)

  Explaination:
<br><br>
This is just a quick site I threw together to demonstrate what I was suggesting.
<br>Right now, all that's coded in is the generation of the submission link using the two text field entrees.
 If the URL ends in a image file extension, it sets the background to that image and displays the
 image URL. If the URL is anything else, it generates a reddit submission URL to my test sub /r/CSStestchamber
 using the title input. <br>
 Eventually, both of these should be done with any given URL (assuming it's one to either derpibooru or deviantart),
 as the site would fetch the actual image.<br> I have also admittedly avoided the hardest part for this demo,
 which is parsing the relivant image database pages for the tags. I have been looking into it, however, and luckily
 it doesn't seem too dificult. Both derpibooru and deviantart have APIs I can use for that. Once I can fetch the tags,
 it's just one simple loop to make submission links for each of the associated subs from your list!
 <br>
 I would also host it off a different Github domain,
 and make it prettier of course.
